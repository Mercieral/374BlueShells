Adding Additional Phases
By: BlueShells374

Instructions:

Creating a new Phase class
	- Create a new class which implements IPhase 
	- Create a constructor which contains no parameters (if needed)
	- The execute method provides the parameters that may be used to design your class
	- Implement the desired logic of the class
	
	Using our models visitor design pattern is suggested but not required.
	If you wish to use the visitor design pattern here is the visit order within our model
	
	Visit Order:
	Model Previsit
	Class Previsit
	Field Previsti -> Visit -> PostVisit
	Class Visit
	Method Previsit -> Visit -> PostVisit
	Class PostVisit
	Model Visit
	Relations Previsit -> Visit -> PostVisit
	Model PostVisit
	
	- Once the new phase class has been created, in the PhaseFactory class add your created phase class to the phases hashmap
	- If the new phase is a software pattern detector also include the pattern name and pattern detection as such
		"Example patter", "Example-Detector"
	- Once that is done your new pattern will be able to be used by the app
